# Analysis_of_CMOS_inverter
This project I started is to analyze the basic characteristics of NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS inverter to practically understand my theoretical knowledge.

# 1. DC analysis of NMOS
"Firstly, I simulated the DC characteristics of NMOS using the following tools:
- Xschem for schematic design
- Ngspice for SPICE netlist simulation
- Skywater-130 nm PDK"

- Fig1: Schematic of NMOS.
  
- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vgs vs. Id for different values of Vds.

Here from this graph we can see threshold voltage is between 0.6V to 0.7V for different value of Vds.

- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vds vs. Id for different value of Vgs.

Here I changed the Vgs to 2.5V and plotted for different Vgs value with 0.5 increment

- The below plot shows the gm(dId/dVgs) and Ro inverse of (dId/dVgs).

# 2. DC analysis of PMOS
Similarly, for PMOS, I plotted the same characteristics as for NMOS and found that to achieve the same Ids current, the aspect ratio (W/L) for PMOS needs to be 2.5 times the (W/L) of NMOS. This is an important consideration for further CMOS inverter design.

I got 500.9 ÂµA for NMOS with Vgs = 1.8V and Vds = 2.2V.

Similarly for pmos 503.47uA with Vgs=1.8V and Vds=2.2V.

# 3. CMOS Inverter Design and Analysis
- Since we know that neither NMOS nor PMOS can drive both high and low values completely, we use a CMOS combination of PMOS and NMOS because PMOS is strong at driving a '1', and NMOS is strong at driving a '0'.
Let's look into the connection of a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) inverter.
- PMOS is connected between VDD and Vo because it is strong at driving a '1'.
- NMOS is connected between Vo and GND because it is strong at driving a '0'.
- From this, we can conclude that PMOS is preferred for the pull-up network (PUN), and NMOS is preferred for the pull-down network (PDN).
