# Analysis_of_CMOS_inverter
This project I started is to analyze the basic characteristics of NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS inverter to practically understand my theoretical knowledge.

# 1. DC analysis of NMOS
"Firstly, I simulated the DC characteristics of NMOS using the following tools:
- Xschem for schematic design
- Ngspice for SPICE netlist simulation
- Skywater-130 nm PDK"

- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vgs vs. Id for different values of Vds.
