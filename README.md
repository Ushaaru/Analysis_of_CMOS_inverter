# Analysis_of_CMOS_inverter
This project I started is to analyze the basic characteristics of NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS inverter to practically understand my theoretical knowledge.

# 1. DC analysis of NMOS
"Firstly, I simulated the DC characteristics of NMOS using the following tools:
- Xschem for schematic design
- Ngspice for SPICE netlist simulation
- Skywater-130 nm PDK"

- Fig1: Schematic of NMOS.
  
- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vgs vs. Id for different values of Vds.

Here from this graph we can see threshold voltage is between 0.6V to 0.7V for different value of Vds.

- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vds vs. Id for different value of Vgs.

Here I changed the Vgs to 2.5V and plotted for different Vgs value with 0.5 increment

- The below plot shows the gm(dId/dVgs) and Ro inverse of (dId/dVgs).

# 2. DC analysis of PMOS
Similarly, for PMOS, I plotted the same characteristics as for NMOS and found that to achieve the same Ids current, the aspect ratio (W/L) for PMOS needs to be 2.5 times the (W/L) of NMOS. This is an important consideration for further CMOS inverter design.

I got 500.9 ÂµA for NMOS with Vgs = 1.8V and Vds = 2.2V.

Similarly for pmos 503.47uA with Vgs=1.8V and Vds=2.2V.

# 3. CMOS Inverter Design and Analysis
- Since we know that neither NMOS nor PMOS can drive both high and low values completely, we use a CMOS combination of PMOS and NMOS because PMOS is strong at driving a '1', and NMOS is strong at driving a '0'.
Let's look into the connection of a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) inverter.
- PMOS is connected between VDD and Vo because it is strong at driving a '1'.
- NMOS is connected between Vo and GND because it is strong at driving a '0'.
- From this, we can conclude that PMOS is preferred for the pull-up network (PUN), and NMOS is preferred for the pull-down network (PDN).

- Fig: Schmatic design of the CMOS inverter
- Let's plot the voltage transfer characteristics(VTC) of CMOS inverter.
Intially I have taken aspect ratio of both pmos and nmos same we can see the output not having good noise margin.
- What is Noise Margin?
  The amount of noise the CMOS can reject without effecting the output is defined as Noise Margin.
  Some of the terminology related to Noise Margin.
  VOH-Maximum output voltage when (logic='1').
  VOL-Minimum ouput voltage when (logic='0').
  VIL-Minimum input voltage
  VIH-Maximum input voltage
  Vm/Vth-Threshold voltage
  - The noise margin of an inverter is defined by Noise Margin Low(NML) and Noise Margin High(NMH).
  NML=VIL-VOL
  NMH=VOH-VIH
  Ideally Vth/Vm should be VDD/2
  So, VDD=1.8V we should get 0.9V
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e69423-f0e7-49e4-8c8e-b57c86c96887)
  - Here we got 0.83V Let's try to improve the NM.
  - From the previous PMOS and NMOS characteristics, I calculated the aspect ratio. I set the PMOS
  aspect ratio to 2.5:1, which resulted in a maximum Vm of 0.88V.

- Let's plot the gain of the CMOS inverter and analyze the NM parameters.
- We have calculated VIL,VOH,VIH and VOL
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec575c9-0b7c-4228-9f0e-386f56165bfa)
  Using gain plot we found out the parameters of Noise margin NMl=VIL-VOL, NMH=VOH-VIH
  we get NML=0.615 NMH=0.643 they are almost equal because we took almost closest to 0.9.
  
- 3.2 CMOS Inverter Transient DC Analysis
- Let's see the transient simulation of the schematic to calculate propagation delay(tp) of the inverter.
  Here I calculated High to low propagation delay(tphl) and low to high propogation delay(tplh) to calculate tp which is given by tp=(tphl+tplh)/2.
  I got tpHL=27.57ps, tpLH=31.93ps and tp=29.75ps (Propagation delay depends upon the input)
