# Analysis_of_CMOS_inverter
This project I started is to analyze the basic characteristics of NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS inverter to practically understand my theoretical knowledge.

# 1. DC analysis of NMOS
"Firstly, I simulated the DC characteristics of NMOS using the following tools:
- Xschem for schematic design
- Ngspice for SPICE netlist simulation
- Skywater-130 nm PDK"

- Fig1: Schematic of NMOS.
  
- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vgs vs. Id for different values of Vds.

Here from this graph we can see threshold voltage is between 0.6V to 0.7V for different value of Vds.

- The plot below shows the DC sweep of Vds vs. Id for different value of Vgs.

Here I changed the Vgs to 2.5V and plotted for different Vgs value with 0.5 increment

- The below plot shows the gm(dId/dVgs) and Ro inverse of (dId/dVgs).

# 2. DC analysis of PMOS
Similarly, for PMOS, I plotted the same characteristics as for NMOS and found that to achieve the same Ids current, the aspect ratio (W/L) for PMOS needs to be 2.5 times the (W/L) of NMOS. This is an important consideration for further CMOS inverter design.

I got 500.9 ÂµA for NMOS with Vgs = 1.8V and Vds = 2.2V.

Similarly for pmos 503.47uA with Vgs=1.8V and Vds=2.2V.
